# Global-Superstore-Sales-Dashboard
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard for the Global Superstore dataset to analyze sales, profit, and customer behavior across regions and product categories. Designed KPI cards for Total Sales, Profit, Quantity, Profit Margin %, and YoY Growth % to provide a quick executive overview. Created tables and matrix visuals to display Top Products and Sales by Region and Category, with slicers for dynamic filtering by Region and Year. Implemented multiple DAX measures for advanced calculations like Sales LY, YoY Growth %, and Repeat Customer Rate. The dashboard delivers actionable insights for decision-making and demonstrates proficiency in Power BI, data modeling, and DAX.
